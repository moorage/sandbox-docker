# sandbox-docker

This repo is what I currently use to sandbox my development environment for Codex CLI, shared in the spirit of openness. It runs Codex in a Docker container and mounts your repo and default Codex config.  It has helper flows that creates/cleans a dedicated git worktree and launches the container against it, to enable isolated parallel sessions.

## Build the Docker image

```bash
./scripts/build-local.sh
```

## Set up the shell shortcuts

Add this to your shell config:

```bash
source /path/to/sandbox-docker/scripts/codex-worktrees.zsh
```

Reload your shell:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

Notes:

- For Bash, use `~/.bashrc` (or `~/.bash_profile` on macOS if that is what your shell reads).
- For Zsh, use `~/.zshrc`.

Optional: copy the default rules template:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.codex/rules
cp /path/to/sandbox-docker/default.example.rules ~/.codex/rules/default.rules
```

Optional: integrate the example config into your local Codex config:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.codex
cat /path/to/sandbox-docker/config.example.toml >> ~/.codex/config.toml
```

## Use `cxhere`, `cxclose`, and `cxlist`

Start a Codex session in a dedicated git worktree + branch:

```bash
cxhere mpm/my-feature
```

Resume a Codex chat by passing the session ID as the second argument:

```bash
cxhere mpm/my-feature <session-id>
```

Skip Docker and run the local `codex` CLI (still uses worktrees):

```bash
CXHERE_NO_DOCKER=1 cxhere mpm/my-feature
```

By default `cxhere` mounts your GitHub CLI config from `~/.config/gh` so `gh` can push and open PRs.
Disable it with:

```bash
CXHERE_GH=0 cxhere mpm/my-feature
```

Cleanup when you're done:

```bash
cxclose mpm/my-feature
```

List active Codex worktrees and flag anything prunable/stale:

```bash
cxlist
```

## Implementation and behavior notes

`cxhere` runs Codex in a dedicated git worktree and branch. You pass a worktree name, which is also used as the
branch name. This keeps multiple Codex sessions isolated and lets you run them concurrently in the same repo.
Slashes in the name are supported (for example `mpm/my-feature`) and are only sanitized for the worktree
directory on disk. Worktrees are created next to the repo in a sibling directory named
`<PROJECT-DIR-NAME>-worktrees/<WORKTREENAME>`.

Example paths:

```text
/path/to/sandbox-docker
/path/to/sandbox-docker-worktrees/mpm__my-feature
```

### Behavior notes:

- If the branch already exists and no worktree exists for it, `cxhere` will reuse the branch and create a worktree.
- If the target worktree directory exists on disk but is not registered with git, `cxhere` will stop and print guidance.
- If a worktree already exists, `cxhere` checks for running containers with a bind mount to that worktree (Docker mode only):
  - Exactly one container: print a message and exit 0.
  - More than one: print a message and exit non-zero.
  - None: launch Docker with the existing worktree.
- If `CXHERE_NO_DOCKER=1`, container checks are skipped and `codex` is run directly on the worktree.
- After creating or reusing a worktree, `cxhere` checks for `.agent/PLANS.md` and offers to create it from the project template if missing.
- Before launching Docker, `cxhere` checks for `$CODEX_HOME/AGENTS.md` and offers to create it from the global template if missing.
- The Docker image includes `xvfb-run`, so Playwright can launch headless browsers via `xvfb-run` if needed.
- If Docker is not running or the daemon is unreachable, `cxhere` will surface the Docker error output and exit non-zero.
